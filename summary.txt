SoundSense is an innovative music suggestion app that personalises playlists based on a user’s movement, location, and weather data. Using accelerometer technology, it adjusts music instantly—upbeat for running, steady for walking, and soothing for resting. Location-based playlists offer region-specific music to suit your surroundings. Weather data further enhances personalisation by suggesting songs based on current conditions. By combining all this data, SoundSense creates truly customised music, always perfectly tailored. Integrated with Spotify, users can seamlessly enjoy their curated playlists and have the option to save suggested playlists for future listening.
