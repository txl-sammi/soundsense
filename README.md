### Instructions to compile and run the application
**Step1** Ensure you have Android Studio installed.<br>
**Step2** Open Android Studio and choose File -> Open. Navigate to the project directory, select it, and click OK. Android Studio will automatically recognise it as an Android project and configure the necessary Gradle files.<br>
**Step3** Add the key of the ChatGPT API to the local.properties file and then build and run the project again. Otherwise, the functionality involved with ChatGPT API won't work.<br>
**Step4** Set Up Emulator. The virtual device used when developing the application is "Pixel 6, API 33, Android 13.0("Tiramisu") | arm64".<br>
**Step5** Build and run the project.<br><br>
**Note:** The minimum SDK is 33 and the target SDK is 34 for the application. The local.properties file includes the ChatGPT API key that cannot be uploaded to the Github repository. The build.gradle.kts file at the app level contains the project structure information including all necessary dependencies.
